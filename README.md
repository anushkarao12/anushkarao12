### 🐾 A Purr-sonal Touch  
Because life isn’t just about code, here’s some *brew-tiful* fun:  

☕ I code better with a strong cup of coffee and a curious cat on my keyboard.  
😸 I’m a *purr-sistent* problem solver — no bug escapes my claws.  
🐾 Just like my cat, I love to *pounce* on new challenges and *scratch* beneath the surface until I find elegant solutions.  
💡 My mantra: _“Stay pawsitive, keep coding, and let curiosity lead the way.”_
